# ThaparEats

Android App
This is the Client app for the Online Food delivery system.
I developed this app for the restaurants in the college campuses that deliver to the hostels only.
It uses Google Firebase as a realtime database and also for the login authentication.
Different Payment services can be added.
For the server side of this system, see my other repository: ThaparEats Server.
